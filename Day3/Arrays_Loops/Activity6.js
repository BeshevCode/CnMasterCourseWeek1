/* Activity 6:
Imagine youâ€™re a programmer for a social media platform! You have been tasked with building a prototype for a mutual followers program.
> Create 2 arrays of followers e.g. bobsFollowers & hannahsFollowers. In these arrays place 4 names as strings. Make sure there are 2 names that are in BOTH arrays.
> Using a nested loop iterate over both arrays and console.log out the matching follower.
